# SWI-Prolog Solutions b.v.

In September this year (2020) I have started a company named [SWI-Prolog
Solutions b.v.](https://swi-prolog.com/) Increased focus on stability
and scalability of SWI-Prolog and the desire to get into closer contact
with real world projects caused me to prefer a commercial context over
an academic one. Covid-19, causing the physical part of the academic
environment to cease functioning, made the step easier. I do remain
associated with the VU (Vrije Universiteit) Amsterdam as a guest.

SWI-Prolog Solutions b.v. will continue to develop and support
SWI-Prolog under the BSD-2 open source license. SWI-Prolog Solutions
b.v. will establish a context that makes SWI-Prolog a more attractive
choice for professional projects which may be either commercial or
research projects. As a first step I'd like to establish contact with
and between professional users. Possible follow ups:

  - Join resources to get things done.  "Things" can be technical
    improvement, improved release management, improved documentation,
    tools, etc.  "Join resources" can be financial as well as _in kind_.

  - SWI-Prolog Solutions involvement to help with your project.  Think
    about architectural choices as well as indentifying and resolving
    bottlenecks.  SWI-Prolog provides many extensions that may simplify
    your project a lot.  Sometimes small enhancements are needed to make
    this work (effectively) for your project.

  - Organize dedicated training.

  - Consider a (paid) membership plan with levels that provide support,
    assistance and influence on prioritizing development.

Exactly how SWI-Prolog Solutions b.v is going to operate is still an
open question. If you care about continuity/development/support/..., or
think you have valuable input please respond using a Discourse private
message or send a mail to info@swi-prolog.com. Responses will be handled
as confidential.
