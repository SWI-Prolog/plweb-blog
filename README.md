## What should a blog look like?

There are no fixed requirements for blog posts. A post must be of
interest to the SWI-Prolog community for a longer period. Some possible
topics:

  - Experience using SWI-Prolog for a project.  Summary of the project,
    how SWI-Prolog was used in the project, how did it work out?

  - Tutorial style articles explaining how SWI-Prolog can be used to
    deal with certain tasks.  For example compare how data can be stored
    (Prolog, RDBMS, RDF, RocksDB, Redis).

  - Overview on what is available to use SWI-Prolog for e.g., natural
    language understanding (NLU), data science, bioinformatics, etc.

When in doubt whether your idea qualifies as a submission, please send
an email to blog@swi-prolog.org.
